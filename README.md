# advanced-data-journalism

Curriculum for Advanced Data Journalism (COMM 177A/277A), a course offered through Stanford's Graduate Journalism Program.

In this course, we learn about and experiment with a variety of advanced data and computational techniques used in the news industry to hold powerful individuals and institutions to account. Topics include:

- Working with APIs and web scraping at scale
- Data extraction and standardization methodologies
- Deeper dive into charts and data visualization
- Data dashboards to guide newsroom reporting
- Document analysis techniques
- Geospatial and satellite imagery analysis
- Algorithmic accountability

We'll examine how journalists use these techniques to develop and tell stories, and then apply that knowledge in small-scale, novel exercises.
