# Tools and Technical Setup

In this course we'll primarily be using Python for coding and analysis,
along with a few other services and tools that are generally free.


## GitHub

- [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
  - [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) - Signing up requires a Stanford student ID and should only take a few minutes.
  - [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) enabled (after getting approved fofr the Student Developer Pack

## Python

You'll need Python 3.10 or 3.11.

If you're on a **Mac**, you can verify the current version of Python by:

- Clicking `command + space bar` to open a Spotlight search
- Searching for the Terminal shell application and opening it
- In the terminal, typing `python --version` and hit `return`

If you see Python `3.10.x` or `3.11.x`, you're all set. If you see an older Python version, check out these [install instructions](https://github.com/stanfordjournalism/padj-code/blob/main/docs/tech_setup.md#mac) or ping me to discuss options.

If youâ€™re on **Windows**, check out these [install instructions for Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl) and/or ping me to discuss.

## Code Editor

We officially support (and recommend) [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the code editor for this course.

After getting VS Code, you should install the following extensions:

  - Python
  - Jupyter
  - Copilot integrated

## GIS software and platforms

Install the [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/) desktop application.

Send an email to [Stace Maples](mailto:maples@stanford.edu) with the library's [Stanford Geospatial Center](https://library.stanford.edu/libraries/stanford-geospatial-center) and ask him to grant you access to the following platforms:

> Please mention the request is for Advanced Data Journalism and CC me on the note.

- [Google Earth Engine](https://guides.library.stanford.edu/googleearthengine)
- [Planet Labs](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/13157872)

You'll receive email notifications once our friends at the Geospatial Center have granted you access to the platforms.
