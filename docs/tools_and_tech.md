# Tools and Technical Setup

In this course we primarily use the Python programming language for coding and analysis, along with a few other services and tools that are generally free.

## Code Editor

We officially support (and recommend) [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the code editor for this course.

After getting VS Code, you should install the following extensions:

  - Python
  - Jupyter
  - GitHub Copilot

## Python

You'll need Python 3.10 or 3.11.

If you're on a **Mac**, verify the current Python version using the below steps:

- Click `command + space bar` to open a Spotlight search
- Search for the `Terminal` shell application and open it
- In the terminal, type `python --version` and hit `return`

If you see Python `3.10.x` or `3.11.x`, you're all set. If you see an older Python version, check out these [install instructions](https://github.com/stanfordjournalism/padj-code/blob/main/docs/tech_setup.md#mac) or ping me to discuss options.

If youâ€™re on **Windows**, check out these [install instructions for Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl) and/or ping me to discuss. You'll also need to install Python using [these instructions for Linux](https://github.com/stanfordjournalism/padj-code/blob/main/docs/tech_setup.md#linux-1).

## GitHub and git

We'll use the [git version control system](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) in tandem with GitHub, a platform for sharing code and managing projects.

- [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
  - [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) - Signing up requires a Stanford student ID and should only take a few minutes.
  - [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) enabled (after getting approved for the Student Developer Pack

Once you have a GitHub account, follow [these steps](https://github.com/stanfordjournalism/padj-code/blob/main/docs/tech_setup.md#version-control) to install git on your computer.

Lastly, follow [these steps](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) to generate ssh keys and upload your *public* ssh key to GitHub. **NOTE**: Leave the password blank when generating your ssh key.

## GIS software and platforms

Install the [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/) desktop application.

Send an email to [Stace Maples](mailto:maples@stanford.edu) with the library's [Stanford Geospatial Center](https://library.stanford.edu/libraries/stanford-geospatial-center) and ask him to grant you access to the following platforms:

> Please mention the request is for Advanced Data Journalism and CC me on the note.

- [Google Earth Engine](https://guides.library.stanford.edu/googleearthengine)
- [Planet Labs](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/13157872)

You'll receive email notifications once our friends at the Geospatial Center have granted you access to the platforms.
